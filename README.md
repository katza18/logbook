#Exercise and Nutrition Logbook

The purpose of this project is to provide a logbook for exercise and nutrition that eventually automates the processes of exercise program adjustment (progressive overload calculations, increases or decreases in volume, etc.) and the weight management and body compositional aspects of dieting (through caloric and macronutrient adjustments).
